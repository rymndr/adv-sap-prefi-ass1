## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).

- Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) this talk about on how software's architecture and its role
is to orgnazie the software's components in order to provide a good services. And those services have their own ability
to use in other softwares in short the softwares can be reusable for other functions.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
• Reusability
- SOA services are designed to be reusable, making development more efficient and allowing services to be utilized in various business processes.

• Discoverability
- SOA facilitates the discovery of services through the use of directories, enabling developers to easily locate and incorporate these services into their own organizational applications.

• Composability
- SOA enables businesses process by arranging existing services that can be helpful for creating flexible
adaptive systems.

• Interoperability
- SOA highlights the use of standardized communication protocols  that enables services to interact smoothly across the
many different platforms. 

3. Define Microservices.
- Microservices is a small, independent component that is desgined to perform a specific business function or process. 
In microservices application it was divided into a collection of self-contained services and each of those is represents a distinct defined piece of functionality. Microservices architecture makes application easier and faster to develop.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
• Ease of Deployment
- Microservices architecture facilitates continuous integration and deployment practices, enabling smooth and frequent updates without impacting the entire system.

• Team Autonomy
- Since micro services align with smaller, cross-functionalMicro service empowers teams to work autonomously.

• Enhanced Maintainability
- Microservices architecture promotes easier maintenance tasks by enabling developers to focus on individual services without affecting the entire application. This modular approach facilitates simpler updates, bug fixes, and new feature implementation.


5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.

Similarities of SOA and Microservices
Flexibility 
- Both architecture promote flexibility making application into smaller and manageable components.

- Quick development, testing and deployment.

Scalability
- Both architecture allows individuals services to developed of one another.

Interoperability
- SOA and Microservices allows different services to work together smoothly without any problem.

Difference of SOA and Microservices

Development Speed
Microservices - Faster development, delivery since team can work indepdently on focused device.

SOA - Longer development cycle since SOA is influenced by complexity of the services.

Adaptability to Change
Microservices - designed to be more adaptable to change since each service can evolve indepdently without affecting the entire system.

SOA - when chaning in SOA it requires centralized coordination that can lead to slow adaptation to change especially when migrating to larger systems.
